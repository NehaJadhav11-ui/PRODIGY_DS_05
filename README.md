Traffic Accident Analysis - Intern Task 5

This project is part of the Prodigy Infotech Internship (Task 5), focused on analyzing traffic accident data using Python and data visualization techniques.

Dataset

The dataset used is:
- traffic_accidents.csv  
- Source: [Kaggle or similar public dataset, typically downloaded locally]  
- Contains 209,306 rows and 24 columns with details like crash date, weather, lighting, surface condition, injuries, etc.

Task Overview

- Loaded and inspected the dataset
- Handled missing values (none dropped)
- Encoded categorical variables (weather and road surface condition)
- Visualized:
  - Accidents by hour of day
  - Accident severity by weather condition
  - Accidents by day of the week
  - Accidents by road surface, lighting, control devices, and defects
  - Heatmap of accidents by weather and surface condition

Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- LabelEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing
